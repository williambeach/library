This library application lets you add and/or remove programming books you've read/are interested in reading. 

You can sort and search for books as well. 

This is a project based off of The Odin Project's cirriculum. 

This project has been offered before introduction to backend technologies
such as node and therefore cannot hold memory and accounts, thus a couple
of button options are superficial. 

Also, book cover pictures use a url in the form for this same reason, we can't store new images on a server with this project.
