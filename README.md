This library application lets you add and/or remove programming books you've read/are interested in reading. 

You can sort and search for books as well. 

This is a project based off of The Odin Project's cirriculum. 

This project has been offered before introduction to backend technologies
such as node and therefore cannot hold memory and accounts, thus the account button is superficial and when you refresh the page, it doesn't save your preferences. 

Initially I used JavaScript to create the form for adding a book, but decided to reduce lines of code by creating form with html and using js to hide/show.

Also, book cover pictures use a url in the form for this same reason, we can't store new images on a server with this project.
